4,"If you\'ve seen the film, you'll remember the wonderful routine in Central Park. It's a big Disney showtune and I\'d be surprised if this doesn\'t end up on a Glee album.",2014-03-18 10:04:00,2014-03-18 10:04:00,That\'s How You Know - From Enchanted/Soundtrack Version,peterjones@test.com,,,,,,,,

5,"This song has that feel good factor, it makes you want to dance out into the street and have all the passers by join in (because they\'ll all know the steps and the words of the song). That's How You Know",2019-05-05 19:16:06,2019-05-05 19:16:06,That\'s How You Know - From Enchanted/Soundtrack Version,louislunney@test.com,,,,,,,,
1,"I still don’t understand what’s changed from all the other previous times I’ve heard and even sung this song, but as I was folding my T-shirts, the phrase “The way to fix up this fixer-upper is to fix him up with you,” set me off. One possibility stems from all of the self-evaluation I’ve had the time to do over the summer; which results in the thought that if the adorable trolls were to singing to a guy about me, telling him the way to “fix” me (I’ll get to the issue of flaws presented in the song in just a minute) is to just be with me, I would be emotionally and psychologically scarred.",2012-04-09 09:09:09,2012-04-09 09:09:09,Fixer Upper - From Frozen/Soundtrack Version,peterjones@test.com,,,,,,,,
1,"The longer I look at this song, the more concerned I become. I like Kristoff, and I hate to say, but his familial band of friendly rock trolls just start bashing on the poor guy!",2016-10-27 08:32:18,2016-10-27 08:32:18,Fixer Upper - From Frozen/Soundtrack Version,marksandler@test.com,,,,,,,,
2," As the song progresses, so does the intensity of Kristoff\’s flaws, including but not limited to his apparent inability to stand in courage and his isolation as confirmation of his desperation for human hugs. I dare you to read the song and tell me you\’d want to start off a relationship with someone that was overrun by some of these flaws that should bring up some red flags.",2021-04-29 11:00:00,2021-04-29 11:00:00,Fixer Upper - From Frozen/Soundtrack Version,joanmckevitt@test.com,,,,,,,,
5,"Dancing Queen has rightly become regarded as one of pop's great masterpieces, both as a song and a production. It captures the Andersson/Ulvaeus songwriting partnership at the peak of their powers along with the inimitable vocal sound of Agnetha and Frida.",2014-02-01 17:27:27,2014-02-01 17:27:27,Dancing Queen,peterjones@test.com,,,,,,,,
5,"It was officially released in the summer of 1976 as the lead single from their fourth album, Arrival, and instantly became a massive worldwide hit.",2018-11-11 11:33:33,2018-11-11 11:33:33,Dancing Queen,marksandler@test.com,,,,,,,,
5,"The song sold three million copies and has gone on to become one the most enduring and loved pop songs of all time. In 2000, Dancing Queen was voted 4th on Channel 4’s television poll of 100 Greatest Number One Singles.",2018-08-21 07:07:07,2018-08-21 07:07:07,Dancing Queen,joanmckevitt@test.com,,,,,,,,
